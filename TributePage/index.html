                            <b>1832</b> She was seventeen, and her mathematical abilities began to emerge, and her
                            interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life.

                            <b>1833:</b> She was introduced to Charles Babbage.

                            <b>1840:</b> Ada flirted with scandals: firstly from a relaxed relationship with men who
                            were not her husband, which led to rumours of affairs, and secondly, her love of gambling.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>1842:</b> Lovelace translated the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea's article
                            on Babbage's newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>1844:</b> She commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a
                            mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings ("a
                            calculus of the nervous system").

                        <li>
                            <b>1852:</b> Died in London, England, from uterine cancer.

                            <b>1856:</b> Her mother became Baroness Wentworth.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>1953:</b> More than a century after her death, Lovelace's notes on Babbage's
                            Analytical Engine were republished. The engine has now been recognised as an early model for
                            a computer and her notes as a description of a computer and software.
                        </li>
